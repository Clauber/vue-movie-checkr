# vue-movie-checkr
This project is a user case for a movie checker using [vue.js](https://vuejs.org) 2.

This project will be using the movie db to pull data for some recent movies and let you search for movies.

Basically this is a little test case on routing, REST api, DOM manipulation and other good principles using Vue.js
