This project is a user case for a movie checker using [vue.js](https://vuejs.org) 2.

It uses [the movie db](https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en-US) to pull data for some recent movies and let you search for movies.

Basically this is a little test case on routing, REST api, DOM manipulation and other good principles using Vue.js

### Notes

Thank you [TMDb](https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en-US) for allowing me to use their API for these samples, I always have fun building the same project in different languages. It helps me to learn and understand important principles.

For this specific project I learned a lot about the vue router especially as I had issues and was able to find the solution online.
